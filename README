The code scripts are a part of the Research Project: Modelling Urban Expansion in Vietnam using Time Series Landsat. 
This project developed a novel machine learning algorithm, Multiple Model Selection, for characterizing distinct urban 
transition patterns using various mathematical equations (e.g., sigmoidal, polynomial, gaussian, linear, and so on).
% classified urban expansion pattern types:
% 1 logistic
% 2 gaussian
% 3 polynomial
% 4 linear
% 5 compound function
% 6 unclassifed
Random forest machine learning technique is adopted to detect, model, and predict the urban surface percentage of each 
satellite image pixel. Thousands of satellite images can be processed and analyzed automatically following a Python workflow. 

Important note: The algorithms are only partial because this research is being prepared for publication. Please contact me 
for project details.
